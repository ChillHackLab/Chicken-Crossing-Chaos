  - **Return to Menu**: Press `M` to go back to the main menu.

#### Funny Events
- **Random Pigeon**: Occasionally, a pigeon steals a corn piece, adding a new one elsewhere (1% chance per frame).
- **Humorous Messages**: Collecting corn or other events triggers funny messages like "Why did the chicken join a band? It had the drumsticks!" (displayed in the console/log).

### Tips for Success
- **Time Your Moves**: Watch the cars' patterns to find safe gaps for crossing.
- **Prioritize Corn**: Collecting corn boosts your score, but don’t risk a collision.
- **Use Pause Strategically**: Pause the game (`P`) to plan your next move if things get hectic.
